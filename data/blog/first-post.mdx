I've been putting writing on my backburner for a while now and so this year, I decided to give it another try. In addition to practicing and improving my writing skills, I wanted to create a space where I can explore concepts and ideas and share a thing or two that I learned from the process. This is, first and foremost, a personal project, but if someone else gets something out of this, then that's a win-win for sure!

That said, thank you for stopping by and see you around!
